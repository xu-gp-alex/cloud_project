This is the repository for the Cloud Simulator project for CS 378. To run this project, you can compile the Scheduler with make scheduler and run make simulator to create your simulator executable. Run ./simulator Input.md to see your results.

For questions, please reach out to any of the course staff on via email (anish.palakurthi@utexas.edu, tarun.mohan@utexas.edu, mootaz@austin.utexas.edu) or Ed Discussion.

## Repo Structure: 

- All test files end on .md (markdown format)
